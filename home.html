    <h1>MISSION</h1>

    <p>
        Our commitment is to the mountain bikers of Boise and their pusuit of "better".
        Better ways to ride, better ways to push and better ways to drink beer. Personally, we think one of the better ways
        to drink beer, is at the top of the foothills, overlooking the great city of Boise after a stupendous ride (or in the middle
        of a ride, we're not one to judge).       
    </p>

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
            In 2021, founders Margrith Wolf and Cody Flores went to Golden, CO and explored the wide-world of breweries.
            It was there, an idea formed. What if their combined love of beer and biking could be brought to their favorite
            home trails of Boise, ID? How great would it be if one were out biking on Sidewinder, Freestone, or Scott's and decided they
            needed to stop in for a little community and boozy pick me up? Why wait until they got to the bottom of the trail and stop in 
            at one of the overcrowded 13th street haunts?
        </p>
        <p>
            Land was located just off Corral's, one of the most popular and widely used trails on Boise's Ridge to Rivers trail
            system. A small building and patio was erected providing ample seating for patrons to find shelter from the sun and a cold
            beverage to renergize them. Local partnerships are important and Margrith and Cody only serve beer from a rotating list of local breweries
            from in the valley below. Stop by, grab a sud, and ride on!
